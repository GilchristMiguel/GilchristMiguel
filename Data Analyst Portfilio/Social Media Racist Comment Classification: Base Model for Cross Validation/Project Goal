Aim and Objective

In this project, I propose a machine learning model for the automatic detection of racist comment across social media platforms.
To achieve this, I will:
- Track down past events and social media trends which are likely to have triggered racist reactions.
- Retrieve annotated comments from public social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok.
- Created an unbiased dataset of racist comments across social media platforms.
- Prepared the data for supervised learning and cleaning the dataset using certain natural language processing techniques in order to achieve best results.
- Trained the model to detect racist comments based on the dataset using the Na√Øve Bayesian Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines.
- Tested the model to determine its accuracy.
- Compared the accuracy of the model when each of the classifiers were used.
